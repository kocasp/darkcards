## Overview
Lateral thinking puzzles are strange situations in which you are given a little information and then have to find the explanation. They are solved through a dialogue between the quizmaster who sets the puzzle and the solver or solvers who try to figure out the answer.

### How it works
The mobile app is a collection of lateral thinking puzzles in forms of cards. The puzzle is on the front side of a card. If you are the quizmaster you can flip the card to see the explanation.

At the beginning of the game the quizmaster reads the front of the card so everybody can hear it. Later he silently reads the explanation on the back of the card. No one else except him can know this yet.  
Then the invastigation begins. All players can ask the quizmaster questions that he can answer by saying only 'yes' or 'no'.  

There are no winners or loosers in this game. Common goal is to guess what exactly happend in the story.
